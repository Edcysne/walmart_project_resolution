# What is the project?

This is a data analysis project that simulates a real-life problem faced by Walmart. The company has been losing money due to missing products during delivery and wants to understand why this is happening and what can be done to prevent it. If I delay committing, it’s because I’m balancing a 9–5 job and college at the same time 😅.

### Main Tools 

💾 SQL - For querying the data
🐍 Python - For EDA
📈 Power BI - For data visualization

## 1st Part

The first part is to join all five .csv documents received using **SQL**. In real life, I would use **Excel** since the files are very small, but the SQL queries are just for practice.

## 2nd Part

I will perform an **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** on the datasets obtained from the previous SQL queries. During the exploration, I’ll find out which drivers are losing more packages, how much money is being lost, which regions have the most lost packages, and much more. This is the crucial part, where I’ll save time by doing all the exploration and visualization so I can prepare a report and eventually build a dashboard in **Power BI**.

## 3rd Part

During the 3rd part of the project, I will create a **Power BI dashboard**. I’ll try to build a non-static dashboard and use **KPIs** that show progression compared to previous days, weeks, or months, along with recommendations.

## 4th Part

The 4th and final phase of the project will be a **presentation/report**, where I’ll present (in video and English) all the insights gained from the previous analysis. On GitHub, I’ll only commit the **presentation PDF** with the **Power BI screenshots**.
